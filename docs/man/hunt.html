<h2>HUNT 1</h2>
<h3>NAME</h3>
<p><span class="I">hunt</span> — Retrieve items from an <span class="I">mkey</span>
index.</p>
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p><span class="I">hunt</span> [<span class="B">-agp</span>]
[<span class="B">-C</span><span class="I">n</span>] [<span class="B">-F</span>[<span class="I">ynd</span>]]
[<span class="B">-i</span> <span class="I">string</span>] [<span class="B">-l</span>
<span class="I">n</span>] [<span class="B">-o</span> <span class="I">string</span>]
[<span class="B">-T</span>[<span class="I">ynd</span>]] [<span class="B">-t</span>
<span class="I">string</span>] &lt; <span class="I">file</span></p>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>The <span class="I">hunt</span> program retrieves items from an index.
It combines, as mentioned above, the two parts of that
process: search and delivery. The reason why it is efficient
to combine delivery and search is partly to avoid starting
unnecessary processes, and partly because the delivery
operation must be a part of the search operation in any
case. Because of the hashing, the search part takes place in
two stages: first items are retrieved which have the right
hash codes associated with them, and then the actual items
are inspected to determine false drops, i.e. to determine if
anything with the right hash codes doesn’t really have the
right keys. Since the original item is retrieved to check on
false drops, it is efficient to present it immediately,
rather than only giving the tag as output and later
retrieving the item again. If there were a separate key
file, this argument would not apply, but separate key files
are not common.</p>
<p>Input to <span class="I">hunt</span> is taken from the standard input,
one query per line. Each query should be in <span class="I">mkey</span>
<span class="B">-s</span> output format; all lower case, no punctuation.
The <span class="I">hunt</span> program takes one argument which
specifies the base name of the index files to be searched.
Only one set of index files can be searched at a time,
although many text files may be indexed as a group, of
course. If one of the text files has been changed since the
index, that file is searched with fgrep; this may
occasionally slow down the searching, and care should be
taken to avoid having many out of date files.</p>
<p>The following option arguments are recognized by
<span class="I">hunt</span>:</p>
<ul><li><span class="B">-a</span>: Give all output; ignore checking for false
drops.</li>
<li><span class="B">-C</span><span class="I">n</span>: Coordination level <span class="I">n</span>;
retrieve items with not more than <span class="I">n</span> terms of the
input missing; default <span class="B">-C</span><span class="I">0</span> , implying
that each search term must be in the output items.</li>
<li><span class="B">-F</span>[<span class="I">ynd</span>]: "<span class="B">-F</span><span class="I">y</span>"
gives the text of all the items found;
"<span class="B">-F</span><span class="I">n</span>" suppresses them.
"<span class="B">-F</span><span class="I">d</span>" where <span class="I">d</span> is an integer
gives the text of the first <span class="I">d</span> items.  The default
is <span class="B">-F</span><span class="I">y</span>.</li>
<li><span class="B">-g</span>: Do not use <span class="I">fgrep</span> to search files
changed since the index was made; print an error comment
instead.</li>
<li><span class="B">-i</span> <span class="I">string</span>: Take <span class="I">string</span> as
input, instead of reading the standard input.</li>
<li><span class="B">-l</span> <span class="I">n</span>: The maximum length of internal
lists of candidate items is <span class="I">n</span>; default is 1000.</li>
<li><span class="B">-o</span> <span class="I">string</span>: Put text output
("<span class="B">F</span><span class="I">y</span>") in <span class="I">string</span>; of use
only when invoked from another program.</li>
<li><span class="B">-p</span>: Print hash code frequencies; mostly for use
in optimizing hash table sizes.</li>
<li><span class="B">-T</span>[<span class="I">ynd</span>]: "<span class="B">-T</span><span class="I">y</span>"
gives the tags of the items found;
"<span class="B">-T</span><span class="I">n</span>" suppresses them.
"<span class="B">-T</span><span class="I">d</span>" where <span class="I">d</span> is an integer
gives the first <span class="I">d</span> tags.  The default is
<span class="B">-T</span><span class="I">n</span>.</li>
<li><span class="B">-t</span> <span class="I">string</span>: Put tag output
("<span class="B">-T</span><span class="I">y</span>") in string; of use only when
invoked from another program.</li></ul>
<p>The timing of <span class="I">hunt</span> is complex. Normally the hash
table is overfull, so that there will be many false drops on
any single term; but a multi-term query will have few false
drops on all terms. Thus if a query is underspecified (one
search term) many potential items will be examined and
discarded as false drops, wasting time. If the query is
overspecified (a dozen search terms) many keys will be
examined only to verify that the single item under
consideration has that key posted.</p>
<p>As would be expected, the optimal search is achieved when
the query just specifies the answer; however,
overspecification is quite cheap. In general,
overspecification can be recommended; it protects the user
against additions to the data base which turn previously
uniquely-answered queries into ambiguous queries.</p>
