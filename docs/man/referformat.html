<h2>REFER-FORMAT 7</h2>
<h3>REFER FILE</h3>
<p>A reference file is a set of bibliographic references usable
with <span class="I">refer</span>. It can be indexed using the softwares
<span class="I">inv</span> and <span class="I">mkey</span> for fast searching.</p>
<p>The strings defined by <span class="I">refer</span> are taken directly
from the files of references, which are in the following
format.  The references should be separated by blank lines.
Each reference is a sequence of lines beginning with
<span class="B">%</span> and followed by a key-letter. The remainder of
that line, and successive lines until the next line
beginning with <span class="B">%</span>, contain the information
specified by the key-letter. In general, <span class="I">refer</span>
does not interpret the information, but merely presents it
to the macro package for final formatting. A user with a
separate macro package, for example, can add new key-letters
or use the existing ones for other purposes without
bothering <span class="I">refer</span>.</p>
<p>The meaning of the key-letters given below, in particular,
is that assigned by the –ms macros. Not all information,
obviously, is used with each citation. For example, if a
document is both an internal memorandum and a journal
article, the macros ignore the memorandum version and cite
only the journal article. Some kinds of information are not
used at all in printing the reference; if a user does not
like finding references by specifying title or author
keywords, and prefers to add specific keywords to the
citation, a field is available which is searched but not
printed (K).</p>
<p>The key letters currently recognized by <span class="I">refer</span> and
–ms, with the kind of information implied, are:</p>
<ul><li><span class="B">A</span>: Author’s name</li>
<li><span class="B">B</span>: Title of book containing item</li>
<li><span class="B">C</span>: City of publication</li>
<li><span class="B">D</span>: Date</li>
<li><span class="B">E</span>: Editor of book containing item</li>
<li><span class="B">G</span>: Government (NTIS) ordering number</li>
<li><span class="B">I</span>: Issuer (publisher)</li>
<li><span class="B">J</span>: Journal name</li>
<li><span class="B">K</span>: Keys (for searching)</li>
<li><span class="B">L</span>: Label</li>
<li><span class="B">M</span>: Memorandum label</li>
<li><span class="B">N</span>: Issue number</li>
<li><span class="B">O</span>: Other information</li>
<li><span class="B">P</span>: Page(s) of article</li>
<li><span class="B">R</span>: Technical report reference</li>
<li><span class="B">T</span>: Title</li>
<li><span class="B">V</span>: Volume number</li>
<li><span class="B">X</span>: or</li>
<li><span class="B">Y</span>: or</li>
<li><span class="B">Z</span>: Information not used by refer</li></ul>
<h3>REFER OUTPUT</h3>
<p>The output of <span class="I">refer</span> is a stream of string
definitions, one for each of the fields of each reference,
as shown below.</p>
<pre><span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">]-</span>
<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">ds</span> <span class="codeV">[A</span> <span class="codeS">authors’ names ...</span>
<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">ds</span> <span class="codeV">[T</span> <span class="codeS">title ...</span>
<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">ds</span> <span class="codeV">[J</span> <span class="codeS">journal ...</span>
<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">..</span>
<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">][</span> type-number</pre>
<p>The <span class="I">refer</span> program, in general, does not concern
itself with the significance of the strings. The different
fields are treated identically by refer , except that the
<span class="B">X</span>, <span class="B">Y</span> and <span class="B">Z</span> fields are
ignored (see the <span class="B">-i</span> option of <span class="I">mkey</span>) in
indexing and searching. All <span class="I">refer</span> does is select
the appropriate citation, based on the keys. The macro
package must arrange the strings so as to produce an
appropriately formatted citation. In this process, it uses
the convention that the ’<span class="B">T</span>’ field is the title,
the ’<span class="B">J</span>’ field the journal, and so forth.  The
refer program does arrange the citation to simplify the
macro package’s job, however. The special macro
<span class="B">.]-</span> precedes the string definitions and the
special macro <span class="B">.][</span> follows. These are changed from
the input <span class="B">.[</span> and <span class="B">.]</span> so that running
the same file through refer again is harmless.</p>
<p>The <span class="B">.]–</span> macro can be used by the macro package to
initialize. The <span class="B">.][</span> macro, which should be used
to print the reference, is given an argument type-number to
indicate the kind of reference, as follows:</p>
<ul><li><span class="B">1</span>: Journal article</li>
<li><span class="B">2</span>: Book</li>
<li><span class="B">3</span>: Article within book</li>
<li><span class="B">4</span>: Technical report</li>
<li><span class="B">5</span>: Bell Labs technical memorandum</li>
<li><span class="B">0</span>: Other</li></ul>
<p>The type is determined by the presence or absence of
particular fields in the citation (a journal article must
have a ’<span class="B">J</span>’ field, a book must have an
’<span class="B">I</span>’ field, and so forth). To a small extent, this
violates the above rule that <span class="I">refer</span> does not
concern itself with the contents of the citation; however,
the classification of the citation in <span class="I">troff</span>
macros would require a relatively expensive and obscure
program. Any macro writer may, of course, preserve
consistency by ignoring the argument to the .] [ macro. The
reference is flagged in the text with the sequence</p>
<pre><span class="codeV">\*(</span><span class="codeS">[.</span>number<span class="codeV">\*(</span><span class="codeS">.]</span></pre>
<p>where number is the footnote number. The strings
<span class="B">[.</span> and <span class="B">.]</span> should be used by the macro
package to format the reference flag in the text. These
strings can be replaced for a particular footnote. The
footnote number (or other signal) is available to the
reference macro <span class="B">.][</span> as the string register
<span class="B">[F</span>. To simplify dealing with a text reference
that occurs at the end of a sentence, refer treats a
reference which follows a period in a special way. The
period is removed, and the reference is preceded by a call
for the string <span class="B">&lt;.</span> and followed by a call for
the string <span class="B">&gt;.</span> For example, if a reference
follows ’<span class="I">end.</span>’ it will appear as</p>
<pre>end<span class="codeV">\*(</span><span class="codeS">&lt;.</span><span class="codeV">\*(</span><span class="codeS">[.</span>number<span class="codeV">\*(</span><span class="codeS">.]</span><span class="codeV">\*(</span><span class="codeS">&gt;.</span></pre>
<p>where number is the footnote number. The macro package
should turn either the string <span class="B">&gt;.</span> or
<span class="B">&lt;.</span> into a period and delete the other one.
This permits the output to have either the form
’<span class="I">end[31].</span>’ or ’<span class="I">end.31</span>’ as the macro
package wishes. Note that in one case the period precedes
the number and in the other it follows the number.</p>
<p>In some cases users wish to suspend the searching, and
merely use the reference macro formatting. That is, the user
doesn’t want to provide a search key between .[ and . ]
brackets, but merely the reference lines for the appropriate
document. Alternatively, the user can wish to add a few
fields to those in the reference as in the standard file, or
override some fields. Altering or replacing fields, or
supplying whole references, is easily done by inserting
lines beginning with <span class="B">%</span>; any such line is taken as
direct input to the reference processor rather than keys to
be searched. Thus</p>
<pre><span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">[</span>
key1 key2 key3 ...
%Q New format item
%R Override report name
<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">]</span></pre>
<p>makes the indicates changes to the result of searching for
the keys. All of the search keys must be given before the
first <span class="B">%</span> line. If no search keys are provided, an
entire citation can be provided in-line in the text. For
example, if the eqn paper citation were to be inserted in
this way, rather than by searching for it in the data base,
the input would read</p>
<pre><span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">[</span>
%A B. W. Kernighan
%A L. L. Cherry
%T A System for Typesetting Mathematics
%J Comm. ACM
%V 18
%N 3
%P 151-157
%D March 1975
<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">]</span></pre>
<p>This would produce a citation of the same appearance as that
resulting from the file search. As shown, fields are
normally turned into troff strings. Sometimes users would
rather have them defined as macros, so that other troff
commands can be placed into the data. When this is
necessary, simply double the control character % in the
data. Thus the input</p>
<pre><span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">[</span>
%V 23
%%M
Bell Laboratories,
Murray Hill, N.J. 07974
<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">]</span></pre>
<p>is processed by refer into</p>
<pre><span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">ds</span> <span class="codeV">[V</span> <span class="codeS">23</span>

Bell Laboratories,

<span class="codeK">.</span><span class="codeK">.</span></pre>
<p>The information after <span class="B">%%M</span> is defined as a macro
to be invoked by <span class="B">.[M</span> while the information after
<span class="B">%V</span> is turned into a string to be invoked by
<span class="B">\*([V</span>. At present -ms expects all information as
strings.</p>
